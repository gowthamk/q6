## OCaml 4.03 Frontend ##

This is a minimal extract of OCaml 4.03
[compiler](https://github.com/ocaml/ocaml/tree/4.03) frontend. It
includes lexing, parsing and typechecking phases. Ideal for
experimenting with the type system.

1. `./configure`
2. `make`

A working installation of OCaml 4.03 or higher is assumed. In
particular, `ocamlc`, `ocamlopt`, `ocamllex`, `ocamlyacc` and
`ocamlde` tools are needed.
